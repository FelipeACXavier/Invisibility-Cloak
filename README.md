# Invisibility-Cloak
Unfinished python code which uses opencv to create an invisibility cloak effect

It works by overlaying a choosen color in the current frame with a previously stored frame of the background.
So before the effect works, photos need to be taken from the location and a color to overlay are needed.

As it is based on color detection, the code works better in a well-lighted environments.
